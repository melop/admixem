Admixture simulator

The aim of this program is to allow users to specify a variety of realistic parameters for admixture simulation, including: recombination rates, chromosomal layout, physical linkage of genetic and marker loci as well as natural and sexual selection. Eventually I would also like to implement indirect genetic effects such as learning into this simulator so that it could also be used as a general purpose modelling framework. A strength of this program is the ability to map genotypes to phenotypes by using any mathematical operations, not limited to additive effects. This makes simulation of epistasis easy and more realistic.
